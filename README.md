# VM Initiator

This is a simple initiator for virtual machines, to initiate basic requirements like password, ip etc.

This library is being used where we cannot use vm-service application which requires python3.8. This initiator basicly runs on bash to complete basic setup.

We generally use this script to initiate older VMs
